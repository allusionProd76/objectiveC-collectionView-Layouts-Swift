# objectiveC-collectionView-Layouts-Swift
Migrating objcio-issue3-collectionView-layout example to swift

Hello and welcome. I loved the [example](https://github.com/objcio/issue-3-collection-view-layouts) provided by Ole Begemann and obc.io about UICollectionViewLayout but wanted to see how it would work in swift.

Here is my effort to convert the referenced project to swift.

Please view the [article](https://www.objc.io/issues/3-views/collection-view-layouts/) for additional information.

Thank you for the indexpath fix provided by Ole.
