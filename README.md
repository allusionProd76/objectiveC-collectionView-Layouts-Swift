# objectiveC-collectionView-Layouts-Swift
Migrating objcio-issue3-collectionView-layout example to swift

Hellow and welcome to this effort. I loved the [example](https://github.com/objcio/issue-3-collection-view-layouts) provided by Ole Begemann and obc.io about UICollectionViewLayout.

Please view the [article](https://www.objc.io/issues/3-views/collection-view-layouts/) for additional information.

Thank you for the indexpath fix provided by Ole.
